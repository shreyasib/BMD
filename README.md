# Predicting Fracture Risk in Osteoporosis Patients

## Data Preparation:
Explore the data set to identify any missing values or outliers.
Preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding, scaling numerical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Model Building:
Built a logistic regression model & KNN model using scikit-learn.
Used Random Sampling to traine both models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the testing set.

## Performance Evaluation:
Evaluated the models using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
Use cross-validation to assess the generalization performance of the models.

## Model Comparison:
Logistic Regression performed better with an acuracy score of 0.83 compared to KNN with an accuracy score of 0.70
